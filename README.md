# TRILIGHT

## Setup for Mac
1. Download the Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MacOSX
2. Copy folders from "libraries" in this repo into ~/documents/arduino/libraries
3. Open a program in the Arduino IDE
4. Push program to board by connecting USB cable and pressing "upload"
Troubleshooting:
- Tools/Board should be "Arduino/Genuino Uno"
- Tools/Port should find and recognize the Arduino ex: dev/cu.usbmodem14511 (Arduino/Genuino Uno). If it doesn't find it, try restarting the IDE with the usb plugged in.
